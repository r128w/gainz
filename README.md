To use, run the batch file with the following arguments:

1. gainz help: Displays help file
2. gainz show: Writes all workouts in the archive to console
3. gainz add: Adds a workout to the archive
4. 4.gainz type: Writes all workout dates and their focus, omitting the exercises in each entry

The directory with the python file, archive, and help file defaults to a folder in the same directory as the batch file, but can be changed easily in said batch file
